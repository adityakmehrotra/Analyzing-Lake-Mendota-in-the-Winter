# Analyzing-Lake-Mendota-in-the-Winter

Using ggplot2 in R to Analyze Lake Mendota in the Winter. Specifically, observing how long Lake Mendota freezes each winter, and identifying the pattern through various graphs.

## Question: How long does Lake Mendota freeze each winter?

To answer this question, I used multiple graphs to visualize the data:

- Scatter Plot (with a Trend Line)
- Histogram (with Bin Endpoints)
- Density Plot (with Vertical Lines representing the Standard Deviations)
- Box Plot (with Outliers)
- Side-by-side Box Plots (with Outliers)
